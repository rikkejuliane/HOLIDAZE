## Project Overview
**Holidaze** is a responsive booking application where visitors can browse venues, customers can book stays, and **venue managers** can manage venues and bookings.  
This project reflects two years of front-end training with a focus on TypeScript/React, accessible UI, and production-ready patterns.

- Built against the official **Noroff Holidaze API**.
- Customer-facing: browse venues, view availability, book.
- Admin-facing (venue managers): create/edit/delete venues, view bookings.
- Custom UX/UI designed by me (Figma).
